           <h5>Meningioma Tumor</h5>
           <p>A meningioma is a tumor that arises from the meninges â€” the membranes that surround your brain and spinal cord. 
               Although not technically a brain tumor, it is included in this category because it may compress or squeeze the adjacent brain, nerves and vessels.
                Meningioma is the most common type of tumor that forms in the head.
            Most meningiomas grow very slowly, often over many years without causing symptoms. 
            But sometimes, their effects on nearby brain tissue, nerves or vessels may cause serious disability.     
            Meningiomas occur more commonly in women and are often discovered at older ages, 
            but may occur at any age.</p><br>

            <h5>Symptoms</h5>  
             <p>Changes in vision, such as seeing double or blurriness,
                Headaches, especially those that are worse in the morning,
                Hearing loss or ringing in the ears,
                Memory loss,
                Loss of smell,
                Seizures,
                Weakness in your arms or legs,
                Language difficulty,   </p><br>
            <h5>Risk Factors</h5>
            <p><b>Radiation treatment.</b>
                Radiation therapy that involves radiation to the head may increase the risk of a meningioma.
            </p> 
                
                <p><b>Female hormones. </b>Meningiomas are more common in women, leading doctors to believe that female hormones may play a role. 
                    Some studies have also suggested a link between breast cancer and meningioma risk related to the role of hormones. 
                </p>
            
            
            <h5>Treatments</h5>
            <p>
                The size and location of your meningioma,
                The rate of growth or aggressiveness of the tumor,
                Your age and overall health,
                Your goals for treatment,</p> 
              <br>
              <p><b>Radiation therapy</b>
                If your meningioma can't be completely removed surgically, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy following or instead of surgery.
                The goal of radiation therapy is to destroy any remaining meningioma cells and reduce the chance that your meningioma may recur. 
                Radiation therapy uses a large machine to aim high-powered energy beams at the tumor cells.</p>
