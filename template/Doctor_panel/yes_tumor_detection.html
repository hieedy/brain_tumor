           <h5>Tumor</h5>

           <p>A brain tumor is a mass or growth of abnormal cells in your brain.
           Many different types of brain tumors exist. 
            Some brain tumors are noncancerous (benign), and some brain tumors are cancerous (malignant). 
            Brain tumors can begin in your brain (primary brain tumors), or cancer can begin in other parts of your body and spread to your brain (secondary, or metastatic, brain tumors).
            How quickly a brain tumor grows can vary greatly. 
            The growth rate as well as location of a brain tumor determines how it will affect the function of your nervous system.      
            Brain tumor treatment options depend on the type of brain tumor you have, as well as its size and location.</p>

            <h5>Symptoms</h5>
            <p>New onset or change in pattern of headaches,
                Headaches that gradually become more frequent and more severe,
                Unexplained nausea or vomiting,
                Vision problems, such as blurred vision, double vision or loss of peripheral vision
                Gradual loss of sensation or movement in an arm or a leg,
                Difficulty with balance,
                Speech difficulties,
                Confusion in everyday matters,
                Personality or behavior changes,
                Seizures, especially in someone who doesn't have a history of seizures,
                Hearing problems.</p>

                <h5>Causes</h5>
                <p>Primary brain tumors originate in the brain itself or in tissues close to it, 
                    such as in the brain-covering membranes (meninges), cranial nerves, pituitary gland or pineal gland.
                    Primary brain tumors begin when normal cells acquire errors (mutations) in their DNA. 
                    These mutations allow cells to grow and divide at increased rates and to continue living when healthy cells would die. 
                    The result is a mass of abnormal cells, which forms a tumor.   
                    In adults, primary brain tumors are much less common than are secondary brain tumors, in which cancer begins elsewhere and spreads to the brain.</p>
