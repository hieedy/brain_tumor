           <h5>Pituitary Tumor</h5>
           <p>Pituitary tumors are abnormal growths that develop in your pituitary gland. Some pituitary tumors result in too much of the hormones that regulate important functions of your body. 
               Some pituitary tumors can cause your pituitary gland to produce lower levels of hormones.</p><br>

            <h5>Types of Pituitary include:</h5>
            <p>Most pituitary tumors are noncancerous (benign) growths (adenomas). 
                Adenomas remain in your pituitary gland or surrounding tissues and don't spread to other parts of your body.
                There are various options for treating pituitary tumors, including removing the tumor, controlling its growth and managing your hormone levels with medications. 
                Your doctor may recommend observation â€” or a ''wait and see'' approach.</p>
             <br>
            <h5>Symptoms</h5>  
            <p>Not all pituitary tumors cause symptoms. Sometimes they are identified incidentally on an imaging test such as an MRI or CT performed for some other reason. 
                Pituitary tumors that make hormones (functioning) can cause a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the hormone they produce.</p>
            <p>Headache,
                Vision loss, particularly loss of peripheral vision,
                Nausea and vomiting,
                Weakness,
                Feeling cold,
                Less frequent or no menstrual periods,
                Sexual dysfunction,
                Increased amount of urine,
                Unintended weight loss or gain,</p><br>
            <h5>Risk Factors</h5>
            <p>People with a family history of certain hereditary conditions, 
                such as multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1), have an increased risk of pituitary tumors. In MEN 1, 
                multiple tumors occur in various glands of the endocrine system. 
                Genetic testing is available for this disorder.</p><br>
            
            <h5>Diagnosis</h5>
            <p><b>Blood and urine tests, Brain imaging, Vision testing.</b></p>
                <br>

            <h5>Treatments</h5>
            <p><b>Surgery</b>
                Surgical removal of a pituitary tumor usually is necessary 
                if the tumor is pressing on the optic nerves or if the tumor is overproducing certain hormones. </p>
                <p><b>Radiation therapy</b>
                    Radiation therapy uses high-energy sources of radiation to destroy tumors. 
                    It can be used after surgery or alone if surgery isn't an option.</p> 
             <p><b>Replacement of pituitary hormones</b>
                    If a pituitary tumor or surgery to remove it decreases hormone production, 
                    you'll likely need to take replacement hormones to maintain normal hormone levels.</p> 
                    <p><b>Medications</b></p>
